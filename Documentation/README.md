# Documentation For Asset Pricing Subteam 2023 Spring Semester

This is the documentation for code/research/etc. It will have pages for each
member and each project/tool.

## Member Pages

- [**Andrew**](./andrew.md)
- [**Sid**](./sid.md)
- [**Tia**](./tia.md)

## Collective Projects

- [**Sample Project**](./collective-projects/sample.md)

## Individual Projects

- [**Andrew - Project Name**](./andrew/individual-sample.md)

## Guidelines

These are subject to change obviously because I'm making these up by myself.

- It's fine to edit your own home page/individual project pages
- Editing group pages needs collective approval
- Documentation format will be determined at a later time
- Have a link back to the main page on all pages

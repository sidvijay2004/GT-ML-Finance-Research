# Asset Pricing Subteam Project
VIP-subteam for ML in finance: Intrinsic Value Asset Pricing


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project aimed to replicate a [study](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877050920307924) on predicting stock prices using Machine Learning. Using data from Yahoo Finance, we employed Artificial Neural Network and Random Forest models. After cleaning and parsing the data, we trained the models on data from 2009-2017 and tested them on data from 2017-2019. The study focused on five companies, namely Nike, Goldman Sachs, Johnson and Johnson, Pfizer, and JP Morgan Chase, to ensure a comprehensive market representation.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started


### Prerequisites
* Python
* Jupyter Notebook

### Installation

Clone the Repository:

Open the terminal on your local machine.
Use the git clone command followed by the repository URL to clone the repository. For example:
bash
Copy code
```
git clone [[https://github.com/username/repository-name.git](https://github.com/sidvijay2004/GT-ML-Finance-Research.git)](https://github.com/sidvijay2004/GT-ML-Finance-Research.git)
```
Navigate to the Project Directory:

Use the cd command to navigate into the project directory. For example:
bash
Copy code
```
cd repository-name
```
Set Up Python Environment:

Ensure that Python is installed on your system.
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended) to manage dependencies using virtualenv or conda.
Launch Jupyter Notebook:

In the project directory, use the following command to start Jupyter Notebook:
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Access the Jupyter Notebook:

Once Jupyter Notebook is launched, your default web browser will open with the Jupyter interface.
Navigate to the notebook file (with the .ipynb extension) you want to view and click on it to open.

By following these steps, you can clone the GitHub project, set up the Python environment, install the necessary dependencies, and view the Jupyter Notebook files.
